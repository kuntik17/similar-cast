# similar-cast / javascript autocomplete search bar 

This was Colt Steele and Stephen Grider's Udemy Bootcamp Course tutorial, however, I add "Finding the same actors" function.

User enters two different Movie name and app gives information about the movies and finds the same actors.

Nice part is search bar autocompletes movie names.
